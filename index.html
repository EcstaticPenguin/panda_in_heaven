    <h1>Tourism</h1>
    <span>Although many of us have been “tourists” at some
       point in our lives, defining what tourism actually is can be difficult. Tourism is
       the activities of people traveling to and staying in places outside their
       usual environment for leisure,
      business or other purposes</span>
    <h1 class="Middle_Head">Which Tourist Personality Type Do You Think You Are?</h1>
    <p>The types of tourists are many and varied. Spend a day at an airport or a train station and you’ll be able to identify a few of these types of tourists.

      Quickly, you will realize that their choice of tourism is as unique as they are. What types of tourists would you think you’d connect with?

      Finding out what kind of tourist or traveler you really are is the gateway to identifying just what types of tourism you could enjoy or those that may have a practical aspect to your needs and life.

        To help you, here’s a list of the main types of travel personalities that are out there. Of course, you may find that you could be many, perhaps all of them and the crossovers would be easier for you.</p>
